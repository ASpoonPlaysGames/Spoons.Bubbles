bubbleColour "0 0 0" // this is done as r g b, if the total of r, g and b are less than 150, the mod will default your dome to rainbow. If you want to use rainbow without a hud message, use -1 -1 -1. Numbers higher than 255 are clamped at 255, and negative numbers are clamped at 0

anim_bubbleColour "255 0 0 1|0 255 0 1|0 0 255 1" // this is done as r g b t, where t is the amount of time it takes for the dome to fade to the next colour. The pattern will loop, but the loop will stop if a colour has a t = 0
// to separate the colours use |

// if a server does not allow animated dome colours, your dome will default to the colour you specify at the top

// if you have more dark animated colours in a row than the server allows, it will just ignore the extra ones
